'\nThis script exports Terasology block shapes from Blender. These are exported as as .groovy files.\nEach block should be centered on the origin, and contain sub meshes with the following names:\n - Center\n - Top\n - Bottom\n - Front\n - Back\n - Left\n - Right\nEach side can be given a custom property of "teraFullSide" to denote that it fills that direction.\nThere are also properties to handle collision\n'
